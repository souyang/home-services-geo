                question: "How often should I have my roof inspected?",
                answer: "We recommend having your roof inspected at least once a year, preferably in spring or fall. If you've experienced severe weather, it's also a good idea to have an inspection to check for any damage. Regular inspections help catch small issues before they become major problems."
              },
              {
                question: "What are signs that my roof needs repair or replacement?",
                answer: "Common signs include missing or damaged shingles, water stains on ceilings, sagging roof areas, excessive granule loss from shingles, and visible daylight through the roof boards. If you notice any of these issues, contact us for a professional assessment."
              },
              {
                question: "How long does a typical roof replacement take?",
                answer: "The timeline depends on the size and complexity of your roof. A typical residential roof replacement takes 1-3 days for a standard asphalt shingle roof. Tile roofs may take longer due to the complexity of installation. We'll provide a detailed timeline during your estimate."
              },
              {
                question: "Do you offer emergency roof repair services?",
                answer: "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency roof repair services for urgent issues like active leaks, storm damage, or other critical problems. Our emergency team can quickly assess the situation and make temporary or permanent repairs to prevent further damage."
              },
              {
